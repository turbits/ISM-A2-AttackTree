## Some feature notes:
- the program does not support multiple selection node actions
- the value display is a bit rough and could be improved to show $ or % on values
- nodes can't have the same name at the same level. e.g., from the test attack tree file, "Node 1" at root can't have a sibling called "Node 1"

The program is a functional attack tree visualizer that can be used to visualize attack trees in...you guessed it...a tree-like structure. I have used `tkinter` and `pyyaml` to create a GUI and to load/save attack tree files as YAML. The program is also capable of adding, deleting, and updating nodes in the tree via the GUI.
